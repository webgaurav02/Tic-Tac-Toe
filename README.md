# EventListeners Pro Max - Tic Tac Toe Game

## About

Welcome to the EventListeners Pro Max Tic Tac Toe Game! This project is our entry for the first round of the "Game of Codes" competition, a part of the annual technical fest, Cognitia, at the National Institute of Technology Meghalaya. Our team members, Gaurav Joshi, Vanshika Sarraf, and Gunnu Lavanya, have worked hard to create this fun and engaging Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

- To play the game, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
- Two players can take turns by clicking on the grid cells to place their marks (either "X" or "O").
- The game ends when one of the players has three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all cells are filled.
- If there's a winner, the game will announce the result. If it's a tie, the game will declare it a draw.

## Features

- Interactive and user-friendly interface.
- Keeps track of the current player's turn.
- Instantly announces the winner or a draw when the game is over.
- Option to start a new game at any time.
